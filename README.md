# AngularJS / Mongo / RequireJS / Passport - Seed

This is my seed Project. 
I use what I believe are good practices, and of course, with a bunch of personal preferences that may be changed. 
No Jade here :) Me no like.

## Core technologies used

- NodeJS
- Express Framework
- AngularJS
- MongoDB (mongoose)

(Other libraries used: RequireJS, Passport, Nodemailer and crypto)

## Instructions

1. Make sure you have Mongo installed and running
2. Run npm install (with administration rights)
3. Run node app.js

## Overview

This Seed provides users with RequireJS module loading, PassportJS registration / authentication and AngularJS as the client framework.

Upon registration, the application sends a confirmation e-mail (make sure you use a valid email address that you can check for the confirmation email). As for now, I'm not doing anything with it, but I plan to add more features sometime soon (Tests are a must).

## Next steps

1. Use lazy loading (I haven't yet found a good way to do this properly. I know there's a few seeds that do this... but I have to investigate how to do it in a kind of different way)

2. Put an email confirmation url to confirm users / allow only confirmed users to login

0. Unit tests / e2e tests
